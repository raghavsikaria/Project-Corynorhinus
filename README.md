# Project-Corynorhinus
To test Sentence Transformers - a POC

The project tries to answer the question: Given a tweet, when you already have a dataset of tweets, find _k_ tweets which are contextually similar to the given tweet.

# Dataset

I've taken the Donald Trump's Tweets DataSet from [DataWorld here](https://data.world/lovesdata/trump-tweets-5-4-09-12-5-16) which was created by [Julian Parris](https://data.world/lovesdata). It contains his tweets from 2009 to 2017.

To just test the brilliance of sentence transformers, I just took 257 tweets from 2016 and 2017.
